Google Maps in MVC 4 with Custom InfoWindow

Introduction

I was recently investigating using Google Maps in a web-application and couldn't find a clear example that showed how to do it with MVC 4. Hopefully this article fills that gap! Technologies used include MS C# MVC 4, jQuery, and of course the Google Maps API.
